# Top::Wines

Top Wines allows you to see the top 50 wines in the world according to Vine Pair. Price and vintage information is also provided. If you'd like to learn more about a specific wine, you can select it according to number to read a short description and tasting note.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top-wines'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top-wines

## Usage

To see the top 50 list, type "I love wine!" when prompted to do so. If one of the wines strikes your fancy, enter its number when prompted to do so. Otherwise, you can type 'exit' to exit the list.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
